Chat for cats

## About

The idea here is to be able to chat with cats directly over ipv6, using
tweetnacl to encrypt the messages.

## Prerequisites

You need nodejs and npm. Run `npm i` to get dependencies. The code so
far was developed on nodejs 15.6.0

.data/config.json should have your tweetnacl generated key pair.

```
{
  "port": 2679,
  "name": "<your name>",
  "secretKey": "<base64 encoded secret key as generated by tweetnacl>",
  "publicKey": "<base64 encoded public key as generated by tweetnacl>"
}
```

## Usage

`npm run start`

## Reference

This project started from 6eer test code.
